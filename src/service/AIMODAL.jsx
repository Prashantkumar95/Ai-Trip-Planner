Walking is emphasized, but bus routes are noted where appropriate.  I\'ve included warnings when ride-sharing becomes expensive.\n* **Food Suggestions:** Provided affordable food options in each area.\n* **Budget Tips:** A section dedicated to saving money in Las Vegas.\n* **Important Notes:** Safety and practical advice for visitors.\n* **Real URLs:**  Image URLs point to actual images of the locations.\n\nThis detailed JSON structure provides a solid foundation for a budget-friendly Las Vegas trip. You can use this data to build an app, website, or simply a well-organized itinerary. Remember to verify pricing and schedules closer to your travel dates.  Enjoy your trip!\n',
